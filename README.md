# angry-purple-tiger

[Helium angry-purple-tiger package](https://github.com/helium/angry-purple-tiger-rs) in C.

## Overview

Angry Purple Tiger generates animal-based hash diegests meant to be memorable and human-readable. Angry Purple Tiger is apt for anthropomorphizing project names, crypto addresses, UUIDs, or any complex string of characters that needs to be displayed in a user interface.

Note that this function has not enough entropy to safely assume that generated names are unique with large certainty. Names are just a convenience for users.
